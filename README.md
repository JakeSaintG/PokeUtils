# PokeUtils

## Pokemon Team Builder
### Features
- Input your dream Pokemon into the field and watch them appear in your team! --Spelling matters. Capitalization and punctuations don't.
- Your Pokemon's name, image, and stats are visible immediately.
- You can change the form of your Pokemon! --Galarian? Mega? Unown X? If the Pokemon has it, it's there.
- Natures affect stats! Pick a nature and see what it does.

### Examples and Special Instructions
Enter "Gengar" as a Pokemon choice.
- Gengar demonstrates both Mega-Evolution and Gigantamax form changes.

Enter "Unown" as a Pokemon choice.
- Unown has multiple different forms that do not affect stats but do change appearance.

Enter "Meowth" as a Pokemon choice.
- Meowth has an Alolan form and a Galarian form. These forms affect stats and type.

Enter "Mew" as a Pokemon
- Mew's base-stats are 100 across the board. Mew is a great demonstration for stat changes based on a selected Pokemon Nature.
